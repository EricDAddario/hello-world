# hello-world
First GitHub repository to learn the basics of GitHub

Hello there. I started to learn programming in September in my Grade 11 Computer Science class. We are learning Java and so far I have learned basically just variables, conditional control structures, loops, and a little bit of the String class. I've also started to teach myself JavaScript on my free time and have learned basically the same concepts that I have learned with Java with the addition of arrays and objects. I want to continue to teach myself programming and therefore, I have decided to make a GitHub account.

This is a test to see if I still know how this works.
