# hello-world
First GitHub repository to learn the basics of GitHub

Hello there. I started to learn programming in September in my Grade 11 Computer Science class. We are learning Java and so far I have learned basically just variables and conditional control structures (but like all the finer details in between). I want to continue to teach myself programming and therefore, I have decided to make a GitHub account.
